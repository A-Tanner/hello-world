# hello-world

Hello Everybody!

I use Github for collaboration, and desire to learn Git
for use in my university classes and for version control
in my independent with as well.


In my spare time, I enjoy working with c++ to build simulations
and videogames, both in homebrew engines and Unreal Engine.


My goal as a software developer is to create complex games with procedural systems
to tell gripping stories, filled with meaningful decisions that
encourage/reward the exploration of novel playstyles
