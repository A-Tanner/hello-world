# hello-world

Hello Everybody!

I use Github for collaboration, and desire to learn Git
for use in my university classes and for version control
in my independent work as well.


In my spare time, I enjoy working with C# and C++ to build simulations
and videogames, and I have experience in Unity, homebrew engines, and Unreal.


My goal as a software developer is to create complex games with engaging mechanics
to tell visceral, gripping stories that are filled with meaningful decisions to
encourage/reward the exploration of novel playstyles
