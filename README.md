# hello-world

Hello Everybody!

I hope to add to my repository frequently as sort of a rolling profile of what I have done
I want to learn Java, Lua, C++, and lets not forget Git!
It is my dream to make videogames and 3d Animations in my freetime!
My priorities in order are to be conversant in engine creation for PC and Mobile, graphics (2D &3D), and sound design
