# hello-world

Hello Everybody!

I use Github for collaboration, and desire to learn Git
for use in my university classes and for version control
in my independent work as well.


In my spare time, I enjoy working with C# and C++ to build simulations
and videogames, and I have experience in Unity, homebrew engines, and Unreal.
